# All In One App

I made this mobile application using Flutter. Yhe app will probably not be uploaded to the PlayStore and the AppStore, so I will use it for my needs only.
It is called All In One because it contains To-Do list, Shopping list and Calendar with reminder, basically every feature I need in day to day use.

## Technology

For this project I used Flutter. For state management I used Provider package and for offline storage I used shared_preferences. I used SQLite at the beggining of the development, but I realised there is no need for it and switched to shared_prefreneces.

### Plans for the future

For the future I have few ideas and features that I would like to add. Also icon and splash screen will be set.
