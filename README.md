# Notify

Notify is the mobile application for everyday use. It is note taking app with some other functionalities, such as calendar with reminder, separated to-do list and shopping list for easier navigation and organization(I found it useful for me in everyday use). The app is different from other note taking applications with its simplicity and it is very lightweight and fast. The data is stored on the device only, so no interent connection is needed and also your data is private. 

## Technology

Project is made using Flutter. For state management I used Provider package and shared_preferences for offline storage. I used SQLite at the beggining of the development, but after realising there is no need for it I switched to shared_prefreneces.

### Plans for the future

In the future there is a plan for online backup of the data, so user can have data on other devices as well. Second idea is the way of monetizing the app, it will probably be trough optional donations.
